========================

Examples demonstrating how to render Markdown with [Pandoc](https://pandoc.org/).

Building the examples requires the following software to be installed:

* [GNU Make](https://www.gnu.org/software/make/)
* [Pandoc](https://pandoc.org/)
* A TeX distribution that includes [XeTeX](http://xetex.sourceforge.net/) (e.g., [TeX Live](http://www.tug.org/texlive/))
* [Beamer](https://github.com/josephwright/beamer) (often included in TeX distributions)

To build the examples execute `make`. Alternatively, `make` can be also be invoked in each of the subdirectories.
